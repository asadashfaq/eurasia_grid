============
This repository contains the code from my calculation on various configurations of a Nothern hemisphere powergrid containing the super-regins:
Europe, Western Russia, North Africa, Middle East, India, South East Asia, Japan and Korea and finaly USA.

Calculations of powerflow is performed using different network layouts, different export schemes as well as different mixes of solar and wind power.
